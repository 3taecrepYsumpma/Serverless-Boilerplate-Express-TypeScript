- Kannappa: He was a hunter who worshipped a Shiva lingam in the forest. He offered water from his mouth and meat from his hunt to the lingam. Once, he saw that the lingam had an eye injury and he plucked out his own eye and placed it on the lingam. Shiva was moved by his devotion and restored his eye and granted him salvation.
- Karaikkal Ammaiyar: She was a woman who renounced her worldly life and became a wandering ascetic. She performed many miracles and sang songs in Tamil and Sanskrit.

The Nayanmargal are not only famous for their stories, but also for their hymns and poems. They composed thousands of verses in Tamil, which are collectively known as the Tirumurai. The Tirumurai is considered as one of the most important sources of Tamil literature and Shaiva theology. It contains the works of 12 Nayanmargal, including the three most prominent ones: Appar, Sambandar, and Sundarar.
 
The Tirumurai is divided into 12 parts, each containing a different genre and style of poetry. The first seven parts are called the Tevaram, which are devotional songs in praise of Shiva and his temples. The eighth part is called the Tiruvacakam, which are mystical poems by Manikkavacakar. The ninth part is called the Tiruvisaippa, which are songs of personal experience by various Nayanmargal. The tenth part is called the Tirumandiram, which are philosophical and yogic verses by Tirumular. The eleventh part is called the Periya Puranam, which is a hagiography of the 63 Nayanmargal by Sekkizhar. The twelfth part is called the Tiruttondartokai, which is a list of the names of the Nayanmargal by Sundarar.
 
The Tirumurai is a treasure trove of Tamil culture and spirituality. It reflects the diversity and richness of the Shaiva tradition and its followers. It also showcases the beauty and power of the Tamil language and its poetic expressions. By reading and listening to the Tirumurai, one can gain a deeper understanding and appreciation of Shiva and his devotees.
